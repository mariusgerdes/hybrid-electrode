## Printing Instructions

### Original Print Settings (Prusa Resin Printer)

These models were successfully printed using. Support structures are part of the 3D models, you should be able to print without supports:

- **Printer**: Prusa resin printer
- **Print Preset**: High Detail Level
- **Technology**: SLA/Resin printing
- **Post-Processing**: 
  - Wash in IPA (isopropyl alcohol)
  - UV cure as per resin manufacturer specifications
  - Clean support structures carefully

### Post-Processing

1. Remove support material carefully
2. Sand contact surfaces if needed
3. Clean thoroughly before assembly
4. Test fit all components before final assembly

## Assembly

Refer to the video_and_photo section

## Materials Needed

- Printed electrode components
- Enobioe Geltrode cap
- Electrode Gel
- Silicon hose for connection to luer adapter
- Syringe for filling

## Safety Notes

- Ensure all materials are biocompatible if used for human subjects
- Clean and sterilize components according to your institution's protocols
- Test electrical connectivity before use
